# Job-Application-Statistics
IT, Cybersecurity, and Developer job application statistics between Nov 2021 and February 2023.

I've kept track and compiled several spreadsheets of job applications i've sent out.
The original purpose was to see how long I should wait on an offer before its safe to assume rejection.
The applications were primarily sent out in three periods of time. Just prior to graduating with a bachelor's degree, immediately after graduating, and after about six months of fulltime job internship experience.

The job applications largely focused on using jobs sites like linkedin, but there are several direct to company applications as well. While applying for jobs I became curious to how sucessful using a job site's streamlined application process might also be (Easy Application). I've used over seven different variants of a resume across the job application period. The resumes include the auto generated type of resume from application sites and ones that i've created myself. Unfortunately I haven't tracked the exact effect of the different resume formats. Ancetedotally the job site auto generated resumes were the least sucessful.

The raw unprocessed data will be included in three separate spreadsheets. I will be merging all the data into a consolidated and cleaned spreadsheet (CSV) for the final analysis.

It will be interesting to see if my impressions match what the statistics says.

Here are my hypotheses:
1) Apply directly to the company.
2) Easy Applications aren't very sucessful.
3) For most applications you can assume rejection from an application within a week.
4) There are still a few workplaces out there with a longer time frame before getting back to you.
5) Make or pay for a personalized resume. *(No data for this)






Future Investigations on Resumes:
Does having a graduate degree make a difference?
What is the impact of having certifications?
Relevant work experience, or having continuous employeement?
One page, or Two page resume?
