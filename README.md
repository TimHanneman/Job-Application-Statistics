# Job-Application-Statistics
IT, Cybersecurity, and Developer job application statistics between Nov 2021 and February 2023.

I've kept track and compiled several spreadsheets of job applications i've sent out.
The original purpose was to see how long I should wait on an offer before its safe to assume rejection.
The applications were primarily sent out in three periods of time. Just prior to graduating with a bachelor's degree, immediately after graduating, and after about six months of fulltime job internship experience.

The job applications largely focused on using jobs sites, but there are several direct to company applications as well. While applying for jobs I became curious to how sucessful using a job site's streamlined application process might also be. I've used over seven different variants of resume across the job application period including the auto generated type of resume and ones that i've created myself, unfortunately I haven't tracked the exact effect of the different resume formats. Ancetedotally the job site auto generated resumes were the least sucessful.

The raw unprocessed data will be included in three separate spreadsheets. I will be merging all the data into a consolidated and cleaned spreadsheet (CSV) for the final analysis.

It will be interesting to see if my impressions match what the statistics says.

Here are my hypothesis:
1) Easy Applications aren't very sucessful.
2) Apply directly to company.
3) For most applications you can assume rejection from an application within a week.
4) Make or pay for a personalized resume. *(No data for this)
